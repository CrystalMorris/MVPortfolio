+ Reflections   


   When we first started with Multiverse I did not know what to expect. I didn't even realize that our apprenticeship would involve another bootcamp program. I thought it would be Verizon employees teaching us what we specifically needed to know based on the team we were assigned to. When I realized we were going to be in a generalized group setting and all learning the same material, regardless of our team assignment, I was very confused. I struggled at first and was frustrated and obstinant in my opinion that the course before us was just wrong. Dan, our coach, told me to "TRUST THE PROCESS". I got angry at him by the 3rd time he told me this, though I did not tell him this.

   After the first few weeks, I gave in and "Trusted the Process" as Dan had kept repeating. I was certain I would prove the process wrong. But I didn't. In spite of myself I learned so much from this program. Not just about tech but about myself and what I am capable of. Most importantly, I learned to humble myself and try doing things in a way I am not familiar with. Being autistic, adopting a different learning method is extremely difficult. I still struggle with this. And I still believe my anticipated method of training would have been beneficial in obvious ways. However, it may have pigeon holed me into a specific area of expertise and I would have missed out on learning multiple areas of tech. While I am still partial to what my team specifically needs me to do, which is Java and SQL, I am grateful to have been exposed to so many other pathways available in my career. I look forward to continuing to work on personal projects involving Javascript, React, Docker, SQLite and others in order to retain what I have learned and expand into new areas as they come. 
   
   I want to thank Dan for his constant support and dedication. He at times served as an impromptu therapist for me when my anxiety levels went through the roof and was always open to receiving honest feedback and giving it in return. And thanks to Linda for assisting Dan in ushering us into the program and helping us to hit the ground running.
