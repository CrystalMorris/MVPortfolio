## Introduction

Verizon acquired a smaller mobile phone service provider a few years ago and as part of the Intelligent Format Engine (IFE) team I assisted in the migration of over 6 million bills from the past 7 years from the original provider's system to Verizon's. 

My tasks included verifying the output of migration scripts to ensure bills were properly transferring to our data system. To do this I designed and ran SQL queries in Oracle SQL Developer against multiple data environments, not only to verify that the data was present but to analyze the results to determine where failures were occuring. 

I also utilized CLI Shell Script to scour flat files for data points to use in my queries and to verify files were present in the server.

I provided daily detailed reports in Excel to the team. This enabled the them to isolate the cause of any failures and correct them.
